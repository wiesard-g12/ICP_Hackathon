# 💼 CoInvest – Decentralised Co-Investment Platform on ICP

Welcome to **CoInvest**, a platform that democratizes access to real-world asset investments for young Indian investors. Powered by the **Internet Computer (ICP)** and governed through a **DAO**, CoInvest enables fractional ownership, automated income distribution, and peer-to-peer liquidity – all on-chain.

## 🧠 Problem We Solve

Traditional real estate investing in India is:
- ❌ Expensive (minimums in crores)
- ❌ Centralised and opaque
- ❌ Illiquid and passive

Platforms like REITs or crowdfunding offer limited control and no transparency. CoInvest fixes this by building **a truly decentralized, programmable, and democratic co-investment ecosystem**.

## 🚀 Our Solution

**CoInvest is built on ICP** using canisters, ICRC token standards, and DAO-based governance.

### Key Features:
- 🗳️ **DAO-Governed Decisions**: Vote on asset acquisitions, upgrades, or sales.
- 🪙 **ICRC Tokenized Ownership**: Own fractions of property as NFTs or fungible tokens.
- ⚙️ **Fully On-Chain Logic**: Rent distribution, budget approvals, asset management – all via smart contracts.
- 🔐 **Chain-Key ECDSA**: Send BTC/ETH directly from canisters.
- 🌐 **On-Chain Frontend**: Hosted on ICP with no reliance on Web2 servers.
- 🔗 **HTTPS Outcalls for Oracles**: Real-time property data with external API integration.

1. **Join & Contribute**  
   Create an Internet Identity and commit ICP/ckBTC/ckETH to the DAO. Receive governance tokens.

   Review asset proposals on-chain and vote using your stake.

3. **Asset Purchase & Tokenization**  
   Canisters execute the purchase. Ownership is issued as fractional tokens.
